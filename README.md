# NAO-Headtouch-test
This module aims to provide an initial overview of the NAO robot's capabilities. A presentation routine was developed to showcase the robot's movements within a limited range, utilizing three sensors located on its head.
The associated functions, such as arm movements, positions, and LED color changes, were programmed using Choregraphe software.


 
________________________________________
FrontTouch
In this phase, the robot stands up and performs a series of arm movements, accompanied by LED color changes. The execution times for both movements and voice actions are ensured through the use of ‘wait’ signals.
 
________________________________________
MiddleTouched
This phase simulates a short conversation with the robot. After each interaction, a 3-second wait time is inserted. The routine includes four short dialogues that culminate in the closure of the conversation.

RearTouched
In this phase, the robot performs a simple farewell, followed by a small dance with clapping movements. Light effects, such as a "Disco" mode, are also included, and the robot finishes by sitting down.

Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the basic capabilities of the NAO robot, focusing on its interaction through sensors and programmed movements. The implementation of this routine aims to serve as an introduction to robot programming and autonomous operation using the Choregraphe software.
